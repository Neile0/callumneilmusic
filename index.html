				<img src="assets/img/headshot.jpg" alt="image of Callum"/>
				<p>Born 1998, Callum Neil is a commercial trumpet player, arranger and composer. With influence from artists such as Miles Davis, Stevie Wonder, Snarky Puppy and many more, Callum is the host to Scotland's most unique sound to date.
Callum's musical journey started at a very young age as he was nurtured by music. Whilst at secondary school, he played with Glasgow based community bands such as the Byres Road Big Band and Zig Zag Big Band, and went on to perform and record with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra of Scotland with Iain Ballamy. At this young age, Callum had performed at various events and venues such as the EFG London Jazz Festival and performances for the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games.
By the time Callum was 15, he had began composing and arranging for his first EP "Crash Landing" with his band The Cosmonaut Arkestra.This EP was a turning point for at such a young age, Callum  knew that pursuing his unique sound was in his best intrest. At the age of 17, Callum decided to leave secondary school to study at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, the youngest in his year. Here, he studied BMus (Jazz) under the tutelage of Tom MacNiven (Hue & Cry, SNJO).
Here, Callum's sound developed alongside his passion for music, which he wanted to share with as many as he could. With his eagerness to inspire young musicians, Callum became an active tutor with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra where he has been a part of projects such as the "VIBE" projecy with Paul Griffiths. Whilst Callum loves to insipire young musicians, he is someone who believes that there is a musician in each and every one of us. With this philosophy, Callum takes every opportunity to work with every musician he can. As a part of Drake Scotland — a creative charity for musicians with disabilities and additional support needs — Callum can do just that by participating in Drake workshops throughout Scotland, one of which was with collaboration with a group of some of his greatest musical influencers, Snarky Puppy.</p>
