				<p>Born 1998, Callum Neil is a trumpet player, arranger/composer and educator. With influence from artists such as Miles Davis, Stevie Wonder, Snarky Puppy and many more. Callum's musical journey started at a very young age as he was nurtured by music. Whilst at secondary school, he played with Glasgow based community bands such as the Byres Road Big Band and Zig Zag Big Band, and went on to perform and record with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra of Scotland with Iain Ballamy. 
<br><br>
At this young age, Callum had performed at various events and venues such as the EFG London Jazz Festival and performances for the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. By the time Callum was 15, he had began composing and arranging for the band ‘The Cosmonaut Arkestra’ and wend on to record on their EP "Crash Landing”.
<br><br>
At the age of 17, Callum left secondary school to study at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, the youngest in his year. Here, he studied for a Bachelor of Music (Jazz) a course lead by Tommy Smith. Here, he was given the opportunity here to play with world class musicians such as Laura Jurd and Mike Stern. 
<br><br>
As an educator Callum has participated in working with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra where he has been a part of projects such as the "VIBE" project lead by Paul Griffiths. He was involved with the “Instrument Armoury” enabling young people to gain a taster for music and brass playing.
