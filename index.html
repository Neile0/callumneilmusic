            <p>testing Callum Neil (b.1998) is a Scottish trumpet player, arranger and composer. At a young age, Callum's love for music was birthed with inspiration from Stevie Wonder, Miles Davis, Snarky Puppy and more. By the time Callum was 15, he had began composing and arranging for The Cosmonaut Arkestra, releasing their EP "Crash Landing". Whilst Callum was at secondary school, he played with community bands such as the Byres Road Big Band and Zig Zag Big Band, and the National Youth Jazz Orchestra of Scotland. After discovering his love for big band and jazz music, Callum was accepted for the RCS BMus Jazz after his 5th year at secondary school. During his time at the RCS, Callum was exposed to much more than just jazz music. Callum began working with Drake Music Scotland, a creative charity which gives opportunites for musicians with disabilites to make music. This opened up many more opportunites for Callum as he educated at workshops with The Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Drake Music Scotland and one of his inspirations, Snarky Puppy alongside Drake Music Scotland. However, when Callum isnt educating, creating music or pulling pints at his local bar, Callum is most likely performing and persuing his love for music.</p>
